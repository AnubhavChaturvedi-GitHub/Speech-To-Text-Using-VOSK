# Speech-to-Text Using VOSK

### 🚀 Transform Audio into Text with Precision and Speed

This project demonstrates how to build a real-time **Speech-to-Text** system using the **VOSK** library. Whether you're creating transcription tools, virtual assistants, or voice-controlled systems, this implementation ensures high accuracy and efficiency.

---

## 📋 Features

- **Real-Time Transcription**: Converts live audio into text instantly.
- **Lightweight & Offline**: Works offline without requiring heavy resources.
- **High Accuracy**: Supports multiple languages with pre-trained models.
- **Customizable**: Easily adapt the code for different use cases.

---

## 🛠️ Setup

### Prerequisites

1. Install Python (3.6 or higher).
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install vosk sounddevice
   ```
3. Download a VOSK model from the [VOSK Models](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models) page. Extract the model into a directory (e.g., `vosk-model-small-en-us`).

## 🚀 Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/speech-to-text-vosk.git
   cd speech-to-text-vosk
   ```

2. Replace the `MODEL_PATH` in the `app.py` with the path to your downloaded VOSK model directory.

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Speak into your microphone and watch as your speech is converted into text in real time!

---

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Audio Capture**: Captures microphone input using `sounddevice`.
2. **Processing with VOSK**: Sends audio chunks to the VOSK recognizer.
3. **Real-Time Output**: Displays both partial and final transcriptions in the terminal.

---

## 📈 Performance Tips

- Use smaller models for faster real-time transcription on low-resource systems.
- For enhanced accuracy, download larger, high-quality models.
- Ensure a noise-free environment for better results.

## 📋 Example Output

### Input:
_"Hello, welcome to the VOSK speech-to-text demo!"_

### Output:
```json
{
  "text": "hello welcome to the vosk speech to text demo"
}
```
